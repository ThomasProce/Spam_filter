# Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on the application of machine learning techniques to detect spam emails.

## Tasks

1. **Initial Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyzing the distribution of various features, identifying missing data, and gaining insights into the characteristics of spam and ham (non-spam) emails.

2. **Topic Modeling on Spam Email**: Applying techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to uncover the underlying topics within the spam emails.

3. **Topic Modeling and Named Entity Recognition (NER) on Ham Email**: Performing topic modeling and NER on the ham email dataset to distinguish them from spam.

4. **Training of a Naive Bayes Classifier**: Training a Naive Bayes classifier and evaluating its performance.

## Results

The Naive Bayes classifier achieved an accuracy of **0.98**, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing between spam and ham emails.
